 Common issues :
  Q: why is it not working
  | A: check the configuration file and enter your token, api key, and user id
  
  Q: how do i get a yandex key
  | A: You can get one at https://translate.yandex.com/developers/keys, I got 75 USD worth of credits free just for signing up and putting in some info.

  Q: it's translating wrong / it keeps translating multiple times
  | A: currently it has bugs, possibly due to it using discum, possibly because it's using the yandex api, or it's just poor code

  Q: sooo many errors 
  | A: install everything from the requirements file by opening a console in the folders path and typing "pip install -r requirements"
